### Each branch - new project

* the main branch with project should have `simple-word` name
  * example: `hello-world`, `todo-app`
* all branches related to this project should be named in `[name]-` prefix with `/`
  * example: `hello-world-/dev`, `hello-world-/feature`
* such convention can be recursive
  * example: `hello-world-/dev-/new-feature`
* special keywords:
  * `main` - this repository (all subfolders relate to different start-conditions). So it should use as start point for any project
  * `dev` - the branch with often commits that should be merged into main project branch
